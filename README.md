# Zombie Maker

A simple browser game where you play as a zombie spreading the infection. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your zombie. Touch humans or soldiers to convert them into fellow zombies. Collect golden powerups for a temporary speed boost.

The HUD displays the number of infected zombies and the current level. Each level spawns more humans and soldiers. When everyone is infected, the next level begins automatically.

Click **Restart** to begin again. To play, open `index.html` in your web browser.
