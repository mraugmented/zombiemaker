# Zombie Maker

Zombie Maker is a small browser game. Move your zombie with the arrow keys or WASD and infect as many humans as you can. Once every human is infected you advance to harder levels with more humans and soldiers. Obstacles create a simple maze and soldiers actively chase you while humans try to escape.

Powerups now include:

* **Yellow** – Speed boost
* **Purple** – Temporary invincibility
* **White** – Freeze all soldiers

Your score increases for every human infected and is saved as a highscore in your browser. Sound effects play for important events.

The game features a start screen and a game over screen showing your final and best scores. Use the restart button or the start screen to play again.

To play, open `index.html` in any modern web browser and press **Start**.
