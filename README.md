# Zombie Maker

Zombie Maker is a small browser game. Move your zombie with the arrow keys or WASD and infect as many humans as you can. Once every human is infected, you advance to the next level where more humans and dangerous soldiers spawn. Collect yellow powerups for a short speed boost.

To play, open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Use the **Restart** button if you are caught by a soldier or want to start over.
