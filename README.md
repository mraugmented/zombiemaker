# Zombie Maker

A browser game where you play as a zombie trying to infect the world. Move with the arrow keys or **WASD**. Touch humans to convert them into zombies while avoiding soldiers. Collect yellow powerups for a temporary speed boost. Clear each level by infecting all humans to spread the virus across different regions of the world.

## Playing
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no installation needed).
2. Use the keyboard to move your zombie.
3. Infect all humans while dodging soldiers.
4. Progress through multiple levels and watch the world infection percentage rise in the HUD.
5. Click **Restart** at any time to start over.

Have fun taking over the world!
